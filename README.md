### Hi there 👋

I'm Kaija (rhymes with Maya). I'm a biologist and data scientist. 

**[Website](https://kaijagahm.netlify.app/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kaija_bean) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaija-gahm-205890167/)**

🐦 Currently, I'm a first-year PhD student in the Pinter-Wollman lab at UCLA, studying the movement ecology and social behavior of vultures.

🐸 I have a B.S. in E&EB (Ecology & Evolutionary Biology) from Yale, where I studied wood frog tadpoles for my thesis [project](https://github.com/kaijagahm/BurstSpeed). I investigated whether a tradeoff between development rate (e.g. how fast the tadpole gets bigger and grows legs) and performance (e.g. how fast the tadpole startle-swims ~~when it gets attacked by a predator~~ when you poke its tail with a stick) could help explain countergradient variation in development rate. If you want to learn more, [I gave a talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CxEaJEx65V1qLG2tahUCO8qabylamchG/view?usp=sharing). The results are published [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jez.2434). Email me at kaija.gahm@aya.yale.edu to get access to a PDF if you hit a paywall on that link!

I work mostly in R, although I've dabbled in MATLAB, and I'd like to learn Python soon. 

**Some other things about me:**

🐟  I recently finished working as a database manager for a freshwater ecology project with the [Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies](https://www.caryinstitute.org/) and the [Jones Lab](https://www3.nd.edu/~sjones20/) at Notre Dame. [I tracked issues for that over here](https://github.com/MFEh2o/db/issues). I also built a [Shiny app](https://joneslabnd.shinyapps.io/lakeLatLongFinder/) to help researchers locate the lakes in their study.

💬  I also worked on linguistics with the Yale Grammatical Diversity Project ([YGDP](https://ygdp.yale.edu/)) to [manage their research data](https://github.com/kaijagahm?tab=projects). Check out the [interactive Shiny dashboard](https://ygdp.shinyapps.io/ygdpDashboard/) that I built from scratch, without knowing anything about Shiny going in ([code here](https://github.com/kaijagahm/ygdpDashboard)). I also built a [relational database](https://github.com/kaijagahm/ygdpDB) for the YGDP.

✍️  My blog, which covers mostly R-related topics, has recently migrated from its old location at [woodpeckR](https://thewoodpeckr.wordpress.com/) to [a page on my personal site](https://kaijagahm.netlify.app/blog.html). The old woodpeckR site is still valid, though!

🤝 I volunteer as a mentor in the R For Data Science community [Slack workspace](r4ds.io/join), where I hold weekly "office hours". I also answer questions over at [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/u/kaijabean/activity/replies). 

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 I'm also on the board of directors for [SORTEE](sortee.org) (Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology), which advocates for open science and reproducibility in EEB.

📫  How to reach me: I love getting emails at (kaija.gahm@aya.yale.edu). Twitter DMs are also great (@kaija_bean).
