### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kaija. I just graduated from Yale with a B.S. in E&EB (Ecology & Evolutionary Biology). For my thesis [project](https://github.com/kaijagahm/BurstSpeed), I worked on wood frog tadpoles, asking whether a tradeoff between development rate (e.g. how fast the tadpole gets bigger and grows legs) and performance (e.g. how fast the tadpole startle-swims ~~when it gets attacked by a predator~~ when you poke its tail with a stick) could help explain countergradient variation in development rate. If you want to learn more, [I gave a talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CxEaJEx65V1qLG2tahUCO8qabylamchG/view?usp=sharing), and there will be a paper soon :crossed_fingers:. 

I work mostly in R, although I've dabbled in MATLAB. I'll write more soon about my other projects. In the meantime, a few quick things:

- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) so I can build an interactive dashboard for my other job, with the Yale Grammatical Diversity Project ([YGDP](https://ygdp.yale.edu/)). This is very much a work in progress, but you can check out a [prototype](https://kaijagahm.shinyapps.io/ygdp_proto/). I'm also building a relational database from scratch for the YGDP. Here are some [preliminary thoughts](https://github.com/michaelchang64/ygdpDB/issues/15) on that.

- :fish: Iâ€™m currently working on maintaining a database for a collab project between the [Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies](https://www.caryinstitute.org/) and the [Jones Lab](https://www3.nd.edu/~sjones20/) at Notre Dame. [I track issues for that over here](https://github.com/MFEh2o/db/issues). I also built a [Shiny app](https://gahmkcaryinstitute.shinyapps.io/lakeLatLongFinder/) to help researchers locate their study lakes.

- :bird:  I blog about R at [woodpeckR](https://thewoodpeckr.wordpress.com/), although that blog might be migrating soon (stay tuned).

- ðŸ’¬  Ask me about birds, frogs, data viz, and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) :milky_way:

- ðŸ“«  How to reach me: email is most direct (kaija.gahm@aya.yale.edu). Twitter DMs are also great (@kaija_bean).
