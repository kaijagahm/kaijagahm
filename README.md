### Hi there 👋

I'm Kaija. I just graduated from Yale with a B.S. in E&EB (Ecology & Evolutionary Biology). For my thesis [project](https://github.com/kaijagahm/BurstSpeed), I worked on wood frog tadpoles, asking whether a tradeoff between development rate (e.g. how fast the tadpole gets bigger and grows legs) and performance (e.g. how fast the tadpole startle-swims ~~when it gets attacked by a predator~~ when you poke its tail with a stick) could help explain countergradient variation in development rate. If you want to learn more, [I gave a talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CxEaJEx65V1qLG2tahUCO8qabylamchG/view?usp=sharing), and there will be a paper soon :crossed_fingers:. 

I work mostly in R, although I've dabbled in MATLAB. I'll write more soon about my other projects. In the meantime, a few quick things:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on maintaining a database for a collab project between the [Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies](https://www.caryinstitute.org/) and the [Jones Lab](https://www3.nd.edu/~sjones20/) at Notre Dame. I track issues for that over [here](https://github.com/MFEh2o/db/issues).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) so I can build an interactive dashboard for my other job, with the Yale Grammatical Diversity Project ([YGDP](https://ygdp.yale.edu/)). I'm also building a relational database from scratch for the YGDP. Some preliminary thoughts on that are [here](https://github.com/michaelchang64/ygdpDB/issues/15).

- :bird: I blog about R at [woodpeckR](https://thewoodpeckr.wordpress.com/), although that blog might be migrating soon (stay tuned).

- 💬 Ask me about birds, frogs, data viz, and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) :milky_way:

- 📫 How to reach me: email is most direct (kaija.gahm@aya.yale.edu). Twitter DMs are also great (@kaija_bean).
